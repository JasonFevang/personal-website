My Personal Site

Overview:
Main page:
Describes who I am, what I'm about and what I do. Purpose, immediately hook a hiring manager who's looking to hire for a job I want.
Contains preview of my latest project posts
Projects: Blog format, contains titles and beginning of content with a picture

I want something with pizazz that shows that I made this site myself:
- pcb traces that have moving, reactive electricity flowing through them. Either reactive to as you navigate the page, or on page load. When you mouse over a button, there's an electricity pulse that radiates from the button you hovered. Then pressing it has another animation. That'd be hella dope
- Something about assembly, like JMP instructions to jump to various parts of the page
- Create my entire page like a piece of assembly code. Sections of the site are various labels.
- Have separate pages of my site be like separate .asm or .c/.h files
- Have a page of my website like C code, with the content of my site packaged in structs and things. 
- Do something with 3d.js and have a part of the website work in 3d?

Have one part like a circuit board. One like assembly, one like C and one like C++ or Rust. That'd be wild epic, wow.

  Hi, my name's(monospaced)
    Jason Fevang(also monospaced cause that's me)
  I program small computers.
  I'm an embedded developer with experience with Espressif and STM microcontrollers. Currently, I'm focused on developing custom lighting solutions adapted to the film industry in Vancouver at Better Way Lighting.

  About Me: Hello! My name is Jason and I enjoy programming computer's at their lowest level. My interest in computer engineering topics started back as a child learning redstone mechanics in Minecraft, and I've pursued computer engineering and software devleopment ever since.
Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege to work with plenty of computers large and small, developing solutions in the lighting industry, and beyond. My main focus these days is building embedded solutions in the film lighting space and have detailed experience in pwm control, microcontrollers and embedded design. I primarily develop on the ESP32, but have experience with other microcontrollers such as the stm8 and stm32.

I have many interests and in my personal time enjoy exploring computing topics outside of what I use in a typical workday, including linux configuration with Arch, the Rust programming language, and open source projects(that's not really true yet). Even building this site with React.js and Gatsby.js

Where I've worked:
Better Way Lighting
  Oct 2019 - Present
  Develop embedded products for the film lighting industry using a diverse array of products and technologies
  Debug issues related to embedded development involving debuggers, 
  Extensive use of FreeRTOS to design applications
  Use software design principles to develop performant, extendable and agile application designs
