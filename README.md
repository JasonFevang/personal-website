My Personal Site

Overview:
Main page:
Describes who I am, what I'm about and what I do. Purpose, immediately hook a hiring manager who's looking to hire for a job I want.
Contains preview of my latest project posts
Projects: Blog format, contains titles and beginning of content with a picture

I want something with pizazz that shows that I made this site myself:
- pcb traces that have moving, reactive electricity flowing through them. Either reactive to as you navigate the page, or on page load. When you mouse over a button, there's an electricity pulse that radiates from the button you hovered. Then pressing it has another animation. That'd be hella dope
- Something about assembly, like JMP instructions to jump to various parts of the page
- Create my entire page like a piece of assembly code. Sections of the site are various labels. 
- Have separate pages of my site be like separate .asm or .c/.h files
- Have a page of my website like C code, with the content of my site packaged in structs and things. 
- Do something with 3d.js and have a part of the website work in 3d?

Have one part like a circuit board. One like assembly, one like C and one like C++ or Rust. That'd be wild epic, wow.
